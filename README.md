#Numberologicalicality
This is a simple numerology calculator I wrote, because I thought it would be pretty easy.

It calculates the Life Path Number (sometimes known called the Destiny Number), Destiny Number,(sometimes called the Expression Number), Soul Urge (sometime's called the Heart's Desire Number), and Persona numbers. Consonants and vowels can have their classifications switched by placing a "!" in front of the letter you want to change. For instance, "Timm!y" would have the "y" counted as a vowel, rather than as a consonant. If you want to go nuts with it, "!T!i!m!m!y" would calculate "tmmy" as vowels and "i" as a consonant.

I haven't included interpretations for the various meanings of one's numbers, because A) I'm not a numerologist, and B) I don't actually care or believe in this stuff :-P A Google search should suffice if anyone actually wants to find out what the numbers supposedly mean.

##TODO
- I should probably write tests.
- Add some basic databse functionality to the back end
- Tweak the UI
